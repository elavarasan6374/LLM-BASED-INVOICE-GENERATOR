MultiLanguage Invoice Extractor: Automating Data Extraction with AI
This project tackles the challenge of manual invoice processing by developing a web application that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) for data extraction.

Key Functionalities:

Multilingual Support: Users can upload invoices in various languages, overcoming language barriers.
Text Prompts: Users specify the desired information through text prompts (e.g., "total amount," "due date").
AI-powered Processing: Google's GenerativeAI platform, potentially utilizing the Gemini Pro Vision model, analyzes both the uploaded image (optional) and the text prompt.
Data Extraction: Relevant information is extracted from the invoice based on the user's prompt and the model's understanding of the content.
User-friendly Interface: The extracted information is clearly displayed on the web interface for easy review.
Benefits:

Increased Accuracy: Automates data entry, minimizing human error and improving data reliability.
Reduced Processing Time: Streamlines invoice processing, freeing up valuable resources.
Improved Efficiency: Automates tasks, allowing employees to focus on higher-value activities.
Potential Cost Savings: Reduces labor costs associated with manual data entry.
Technical Details (Optional):

The application is built using Streamlit for the web interface and dotenv for secure environment variable management.
Google's GenerativeAI platform provides the AI capabilities, potentially powered by the versatile Gemini Pro Vision model for multimodal processing of images and text.
